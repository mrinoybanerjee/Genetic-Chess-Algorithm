# Genetic-Chess-Algorithm

Based on Charles Darwin's theory of evolution of species, the evolutionary algorithm helps our chess player get better with each game and each generation. This eventually results in a very intelligent and efficient algorithm. 

I created a program that was given the basic rules of chess and “DNA” that told each chess AI how to weigh moves. Then simulated evolution by having the AIs compete against each other and only allowed the winners to pass on their “genes.” In its current form through evolution, the AI can beat average human players.
