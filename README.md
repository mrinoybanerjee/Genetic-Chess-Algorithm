# Genetic-Chess-Algorithm

Created a program that was given the basic rules of chess and “DNA” that told each chess AI how to weigh moves. Then simulated evolution by having the AIs compete against each other and only allowed the winners to pass on their “genes.” In its current form through evolution, the AI can beat average human players.
